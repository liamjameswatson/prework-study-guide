# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for me and other bootcamp students who are going through Prework.
It is intended to keep notes on topics in one place, and therefore easier to study later.
The topics on this page include: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, split into sections.

To use this study guide, you can simply look at the notes for each section.

If you don't know which one to read first, open the Chrome DevTools by right clicking, and choosing inspect from the menu. A panel will open, either below or to the side of the webpage. Navigate to the console tab. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion of which topic to study first.
