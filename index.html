          <li>Meta elements contain</li>
          <li>Elements inside other elments are said to be 'nested'.  Child elements are nested inside parent elements</li>
          <li>Attributes provide extra infromation for the element. They are written inside the opening element.</li>
          <li>There is one h1 element on each page. (The main header)</li>
          <li>Content is written between an opening tag and closing tag</li>

            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A border indicates how much space we want between the margin and padding</li>
            <li>Three ways to write css: Inline - in the attribute of an element, Internal - using the style tag, inside the head element, External - In a seperate .css file, with a link to the html file</li>
            <li>A declaration block are multiple declarations that are written between curly brackets, and apply to the same selector </li>
            <li>A declaration is a property:value pair</li>
            <li>A selector is the element that the property: value should target. eg. h1</li>
            <li>A property is the characteristic of an element you want to change, eg. colour</li>
            <li>A value is how you want to change a propery eg. blue</li>
            <li>Add a class to a HTML element attribute to target multiple elements</li>
            <li>Add an id to a HTML element to target a single element</li>
            <li>Dry (Do not repeat yourself is important), so if you're writting the same value many times, you can list properties.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
           <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The best way to write JS is in an external file and linking it in the footer of the HTML page, under the footer or main closing element but above the body closing emlement</li>
          <li>JS code is written as data types eg. A string is written between quotation marks: ""HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript""</li>
          <li>These data types can be stored as variables: var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript" - 4 strings in one varible</li>
          <li>Variable can be accessed passing the variable name to a function eg. console.log(topics)</li>
          <li>The order that JS code is executed can be controlled with conditional statement.</li>
          <li>One example of a conditional statement is an "if statement". If a certain condition is met - one set of instructions is carried out. If not, another set is executed.</li>
          <li>If statements are normally boolean values, which a condition can be true or false. If it true - it is known as truthy. Falsy statements are  0, -0, On, ""(a blank string), null, undefined, NaN (not a number).</li>
          <li>=== is a strict equality operator. it compares two values to see if they're the same. Compares left side to right. if same = true, if different = false</li>
          <li>Another way of storing data types is in an array. Meant for storing a list of data, each separated by a comma. These can be strings, numbers, boolean which are written between [] (open brackets).</li>
          <li>arrayName =['string', number, boolean]</li>
          <li>These are then stored with a name, and can be accessed by the index position, starting from 0. arrayName[0] would access the first data value of an array.</li>
          <li>arrayName[0], gives the value in frist index postion of array.</li>
          <li>A for loop can iterate over an array and print out every position.</li>
          <li>A for loop is needs a for keyword, at the start, a conditional statement (see next list-item), and a code block( so the computer knows what to do on each iteration).</li>
          <li>A for loops conditional statement needs a starting point (a variable, x=0), a condition (so it knows when to end, x < arrayName.length), and a predictable pattern to know how to iterate eg. +1.</li>
          <li>A shortcut for x = x + 1 is x++. For every iteration, x increases by 1</li>
          <li>arrayname.length gives the number of indeces in the array.</li>
          <li>A function is an easy way to reuse a block of code. The function must have a keyword function, before the name of the function, followed by parentheses. After this, the code is written between {} (curly brackets).</li>
          <li>To call a function, write the function name followed by (). Now all the code in the block will be executed.</li>
        </ul>

<!-- git workflow: 
  1) cd into folder
  2) check which branch: git status - if not in the right branch switch
  3) git checkout main
